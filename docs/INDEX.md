# Documentation index

This is the front door for Helios's design documentation. Helios is currently a **design-only repository**: documents can describe an accepted direction, but no design is implemented or validated until source code and evidence exist.

Last updated: 12 July 2026.

## Status vocabulary

Every important claim should be understood through one of these states:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Proposed** | A candidate product or technical choice that may change during a spike |
| **Accepted** | The current direction; changing it requires new evidence and a decision-log update |
| **Implemented** | Present in source code and exercised by at least one automated or manual path |
| **Validated** | Meets a recorded acceptance threshold on named hardware/data, with evidence |

Unless a document explicitly says otherwise, product scope and logged decisions are **accepted**, architecture details are **proposed**, and implementation/performance claims are **not started**.

## Source-of-truth hierarchy

When two documents disagree, use this ownership order rather than guessing:

| Question | Authoritative document |
|---|---|
| What product are we making? What is in or out of v1? | [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md) |
| What is the current status and what should a newcomer read? | [README.md](../README.md) and this index |
| In what order will work ship? | [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) |
| How is the software intended to work? | [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Why was a contested choice made? | [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) |
| What exact claim must be proved? | [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) |
| What data is used and what may we say about it? | [DATA_AND_PROVENANCE.md](DATA_AND_PROVENANCE.md) |
| Which platform or GPU is supported? | [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) |
| Is the total plan credible? | [FEASIBILITY.md](FEASIBILITY.md) |
| What do the terms mean? | [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) |
| What may contributors submit? | [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) |
| What licenses apply? | [LICENSING.md](../LICENSING.md), [LICENSE](../LICENSE), and dataset manifests |

A decision record can constrain architecture, but it does not silently add product scope. A roadmap item can schedule a requirement, but it does not redefine that requirement. Validation evidence can reveal that an accepted design is wrong; that should trigger a new decision rather than hiding the result.

## Reading paths

### I just found the project

1. [README.md](../README.md)
2. [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md)
3. [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md)
4. [FEASIBILITY.md](FEASIBILITY.md)

### I want to implement it

1. [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)
3. [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md)
4. [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md)
5. [DATA_AND_PROVENANCE.md](DATA_AND_PROVENANCE.md)
6. [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

### I want to evaluate the scientific or data claims

1. [DATA_AND_PROVENANCE.md](DATA_AND_PROVENANCE.md)
2. [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md)
3. The astronomy, coordinate, terrain, and HDR sections of [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
4. [FEASIBILITY.md](FEASIBILITY.md)

### I want to use or commercially license Helios

There is no usable build or operational commercial-license process yet. Read [LICENSING.md](../LICENSING.md) for the intended model and its unresolved prerequisites. Do not treat the draft [CLA.md](../CLA.md) as a signable agreement.

Directories expected at Milestone 0, but not present today:

```text
src/          application and library sources
shaders/      Slang sources and shader ABI tests
tools/        offline data/catalog bakers
tests/        unit, property, integration, and numeric tests
cmake/        build helpers and dependency pins
data/         small manifests only; large datasets stay external
evidence/     generated milestone reports or links to release artifacts
```

## Keeping the documents honest

- Use future tense for planned behavior and present tense only for repository facts.
- Do not upgrade a claim from accepted to implemented or validated without linking evidence.
- Give every numeric promise a range, unit, scenario, threshold, and reference.
- Distinguish source-data resolution, generated sample spacing, numerical precision, visual stability, and model accuracy; they are different quantities.
- Record exact dataset releases and licenses instead of naming an agency or family of products.
- Keep long-term ideas below the Milestone 10 gate unless a decision deliberately changes v1.
